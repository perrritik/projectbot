Hello everyone! So, if you want to use my code, and you use vs code or pycharm in one time, you need to install libraries : discord.py, and etc.
If you don`t have any discord-bot in discord developer site, create it and copy the token. After that, paste it in the bottom in the code in the "bot.run("PASTE TOKEN HERE)"
I think that you know how start it and use.But, its in the russian languge. Use chatgpt to translate it!
